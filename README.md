# Contrastive UnderWater Restoration (CWR)
We provide our PyTorch implementation of unpaired image-to-image translation based on patchwise contrastive learning and dual adversarial learning. Compared to [CycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN), our model trains faster and performs better. Compared to [CUT](http://taesung.me/ContrastiveUnpairedTranslation/), our model is more robust and usually achieves better performance.

We thank Taesung for his work. Our work is inspired by CUT.
